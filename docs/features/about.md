# About

CpExtra has an extensive list of features. Some features are big and some are small. 

::: warning
Many of CpExtra's features are accessed through command/prefrence/info variables. The help for those features is primarily covered in the **Variables** section.
Event listeners are an exception as although they are set with the xcmndAddEventListener and xcmndRemoveEventListener variables, we felt the concept of event listening was deep enough that it required its own page in this section to explain it.
